# Tables

Tables carry some very simple styles just to make them feel consistent, they have a width of 100% so they fill their parent element.

Tables can be tied into tabs so that the appropriate table can be displayed.

The following classes can be added to table rows:

* ```.selected``` - will color the row green
* ```.warning``` - will color the row red
