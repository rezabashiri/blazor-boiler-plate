<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

You can see plenty of individual projects on .net clean code or CQRS implementation in .net, but what if you need all those in micro-service enabled template? Or

What if you need to authorize clients by passwordflow?
What if you are new in blazor type and need to authenticate clients by JWT in it?
Are you exhausted of initiating project and do repeatedly efforts project to project?
Would you like to a have a separate servie to not only authorize your api by JWT but also authorize your Blazor clients interatedly?

What you will achieve :

- A micro-service architectured OpenIdConnect and identity authorization service
- A clean code and Multi-Tiered structure
- Hangfire installed and configured to do back ground jobs
- CQRS pattern enabled by using of MediatR library
- Unit and integration tests
- Configuration and usage of AutoMapper library
- Good example of how to use docker compose to connect two project by docker compose
