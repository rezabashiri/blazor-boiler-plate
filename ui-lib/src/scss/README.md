# Atomic CSS Bolt-on Framework for Karma CSS

## Karma CSS Boilerplate

Karma CSS is a mobile first, responsive CSS boilerplate framework built on top of normalize and a powerful flexbox grid system. Our aim is to provide a sensible set css defaults that DO NOT impose any style on the end result. But provides enough building blocks to quickly get started and aid construction of your site.

You can read more about this boilerplate [here](http://karmacss.com/).

## Atomic Design

The remainder of this framework has been developed to adhere to the principles of Atomic Design utilising BEM syntax. It lays down a solid structure that aids both the initial development and maintenance of web styles.

This starter kit gives suggested atoms, molecules and organisms as a guide for defining your own components. The kit is also 'technology independent' though there are examples of how to implement integration with a Fontello font for supplying iconography as well as a SASS file of common WordPress core overrides. These can be deleted if they are not required.

## Installation

Simply pluck a copy from this repo and place it in the appropriate place within the file structure of your project. Dont't forget to install Karma CSS too!

It's WITHOUT vendor prefixes, so bare that in mind when compiling.
